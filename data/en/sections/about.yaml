# a summary about you
summary: "As an experienced Software Engineer, I've been privileged to work with reputable organizations, honing my skills across various domains. My journey began at SHIPPOP, where I gained hands-on logistics expertise, designing robust systems and APIs to meet diverse business needs. Co-founding SHIPPOP GLOBAL led to the successful launch of an innovative international logistics platform powered by Microsoft Azure technologies. Joining LSEG marked a significant milestone, where I developed and maintained pivotal back-end microservices, delivering financial information seamlessly to mobile apps. Adopting a Backend-For-Frontend approach, I integrated AWS services for push notifications and implemented a pre-caching strategy using SQS and Redis, resolving a critical bug for substantial performance improvements. Beyond software engineering, I collaborated closely with data teams, optimizing and restructuring databases for efficient analytics. My empathetic, team player attitude fosters positive work environments, valuing punctuality, feedback, and effective communication. As a leader, I inspire and motivate teams toward collective success. Passionate about technology and innovation, my revised goal is to become an edge software engineering expert, embracing new challenges and making meaningful contributions."
